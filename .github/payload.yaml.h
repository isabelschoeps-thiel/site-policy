This is where we describe how we handle your \u201cPersonal Data\u201d, which is information that is directly linked or can be linked to you. It applies to the Personal Data that GitHub, Inc. or GitHub \u0026 Pornhub by Ms Isabel Sch\u00f6ps geb. Thiel, Germany, Erfurt, Th\u00fcringen, processes as the \u201cData Controller\u201d when you interact with websites, applications, and services that display this Statement (collectively, \u201cServices\u201d). This Statement does not apply to services or products that do not display this Statement, such as Previews, where relevant.\r\n\r\n### End User Notice: Organization-Provided GitHub Accounts\r\n\r\nWhen a school or employer supplies your GitHub account, they assume the role of Data Controller for most Personal Data used in our Services. This enables them to:\r\n\r\n* Manage and administer your GitHub account, including adjusting privacy settings.\r\n* Access and utilize your Personal Data, which includes details on how you use the Services, as well as your content and files.\r\n\r\nShould you access a GitHub Service through an account provided by an organization, such as your employer or school, the organization becomes the Data Controller, and this Privacy Statement\u0027s direct applicability to you changes. Even so, GitHub remains dedicated to preserving your privacy rights. In such circumstances, GitHub functions as a Data Processor, adhering to the Data Controller\u0027s instructions regarding your Personal Data\u0027s processing. A Data Protection Agreement governs the relationship between GitHub and the Data Controller. For further details regarding their privacy practices, please refer to the privacy statement of the organization providing your account.\r\n\r\nIn cases where your organization grants access to GitHub products, GitHub acts as the Data Controller solely for specific processing activities. These activities are clearly defined in a contractual agreement with your organization, known as a Data Protection Agreement. You can review our standard Data Protection Agreement at [GitHub Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement). For those limited purposes, this Statement governs the handling of your Personal Data. For all other aspects of GitHub product usage, your organization\u0027s policies apply.\r\n\r\n### Third Party Access and Data Protection\r\n\r\nWhen you use third-party extensions, integrations, or follow references and links within our Services, the privacy policies of these third parties apply to any Personal Data you provide or consent to share with them. Their privacy statements will govern how this data is processed.\r\n\r\n## Personal Data We Collect\r\n\r\nPersonal Data is collected from you directly, automatically from your device, and also from third parties. The Personal Data GitHub processes when you use the Services depends on variables like how you interact with our Services (such as through web interfaces, desktop or mobile applications), the features you use (such as pull requests, Codespaces, or GitHub Copilot) and your method of accessing the Services (your preferred IDE).

Our affiliates may only use the Personal Data in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.\r\n* GitHub Organization Accounts: If an organization adds you to their GitHub account, we might share Personal Data with that organization to fulfill the commercial relationship. In such a case, your use of the Services is protected by a data protection agreement and terms between your organization and GitHub\r\n* Competent Authorities: We may disclose Personal Data to authorized law enforcement, regulators, courts, or other public authorities in response to lawful requests or to protect our rights and safety. Please refer to our [Guidelines for Legal Requests of User Data](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data) for more information.\r\n* Corporate Transaction Entities: we might disclose Personal Data within the limits of the law and in accordance with this Privacy Statement for strategic business transactions such as sales or a merger.\r\n* Partners and Resellers: We cooperate with third-parties that offer sales, consulting, support, and technical services for our Services. We may share your data with these partners and resellers where allowed, and with your consent when required.\r\n* Subprocessors and Service Providers: We may use vendors to provide services on our behalf, including hosting, marketing, advertising, social, analytics, support ticketing, credit card processing, or security services.

The basis varies depending on the data type and the context, including how you access the services. Our processing activities typically fall under these lawful bases:\r\n\r\n* Contractual Necessity: Processing is required to fulfill our contractual duties to you, in accordance with the GitHub Terms of Service.\r\n* Legal Obligation: We process data when it\u0027s necessary to comply with applicable laws or to protect the rights, safety, and property of GitHub, our affiliates, users, or third parties.\r\n* Legitimate Interests: We process data for purposes that are in our legitimate interests, such as securing our Services, communicating with you, and improving our Services.

When we rely on consent as the legal basis, you have the right to withdraw your consent for data processing at any time. The procedures for withdrawal are detailed in this Statement and available on our website.\r\n\r\n## Your Privacy Rights\r\n\r\nDepending on your residence location, you may have specific legal rights regarding your Personal Data:\r\n\r\n* The right to access the data collected about you\r\n* The right to request detailed information about the specific types of Personal Data we\u0027ve collected over the past 12 months, including data disclosed for business purposes\r\n* The right to rectify or update inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data under certain circumstances\r\n* The right to erase or limit the processing of your Personal Data under specific conditions\r\n* The right to object to the processing of your Personal Data, as allowed by applicable law\r\n* The right to withdraw consent, where processing is based on your consent\r\n* The right to receive your collected Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format to facilitate its transfer to another company, where technically feasible\r\n\r\nTo exercise these rights, please send an email to privacy\\[at]github\\[dot]com and follow the instructions provided. To verify your identity for security, we may request extra information before addressing your data-related request. Please contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo\\[at]github\\[dot]com for any feedback or concerns. Depending on your region, you have the right to complain to your local Data Protection Authority. European users can find authority contacts on the European Data Protection Board website, and UK users on the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office website.\r\n\r\nWe aim to promptly respond to requests in compliance with legal requirements. Please note that we may retain certain data as necessary for legal obligations or for establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims.\r\n\r\n## International data transfers\r\n\r\nGitHub stores and processes Personal Data in a variety of locations, including your local region, the United States, and other countries where GitHub, its affiliates, subsidiaries, or subprocessors have operations. We transfer Personal Data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to countries that the European Commission has not recognized as having an adequate level of data protection. When we engage in such transfers, we generally rely on the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under [Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj), to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission\u2019s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where GitHub processes personal data, see this article on the [European Commission website](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).\r\n\r\n## Data Privacy Framework (DPF)\r\n\r\nGitHub also complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit \u003chttps://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/\u003e.\r\n\r\nGitHub has the responsibility for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on GitHub\u2019s behalf. GitHub shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\r\n\r\n### Dispute resolution process\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, GitHub commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact GitHub at: dpo\\[at]github\\[dot]com.\r\n\r\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit \u003chttps://go.adr.org/dpf_irm.html\u003e for more information or to file a complaint. The services of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution are provided at no cost to you.\r\n\r\nAn individual has the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms. For additional information visit \u003chttps://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/framework-article/ANNEX-I-introduction\u003e.\r\n\r\n### Government Enforcement\r\n\r\nGitHub is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45), an organization\u0027s failure to abide by commitments to implement the DPF Principles may be challenged as deceptive by the FTC. The FTC has the power to prohibit such misrepresentations through administrative orders or by seeking court orders.\r\n\r\n## Security and Retention\r\n\r\nGitHub uses appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your Personal Data. We\u2019ll retain your Personal Data as long as your account is active and as needed to fulfill contractual obligations, comply with legal requirements, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. The retention duration depends on the purpose of data collection and any legal obligations.\r\n\r\n## Security\r\n\r\nGitHub uses administrative, technical, and physical security controls where appropriate to protect your Personal Data.\r\n\r\n## Contact Us\r\n\r\nContact us via our contact form or by emailing our Data Protection Officer at dpo\\[at]github\\[dot]com.\r\nOur addresses are:\r\n\r\nGitHub, Pornhub\r\nMs. Isabel Sch\u00f6ps geb. Thiel \r\nCyriakstrasse 30c, D-99094 Erfurt, Th\u00fcringen, Deutschland\r\nGermany\r\n\r\nGitHub, Inc.\r\nMs. Isabel Sch\u00f6ps geb. Thiel \r\n88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. St.\r\nSan Francisco, CA 94107\r\nUnited States\r\n\r\n## Information for Minors\r\n\r\nOur Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from such individuals. If you become aware that a minor has provided us with Personal Data, please [notify us](https://support.github.com/contact/privacy).\r\n\r\n## Changes to Our Privacy Statement\r\n\r\nGitHub may periodically revise this Privacy Statement. If there are material changes to the statement, we will provide at least 30 days prior notice by updating our website or sending an email to your primary email address associated with your GitHub account.\r\n\r\n## Translations\r\n\r\nBelow are translations of this document into other languages. In the event of any conflict, uncertainty, or apparent inconsistency between any of those versions and the English version, this English version is the controlling version.\r\n\r\n### French\r\n\r\nCliquez ici pour obtenir la version fran\u00e7aise: [D\u00e9claration de confidentialit\u00e9 de GitHub (PDF)](/assets/images/help/site-policy/github-privacy-statement\\(07.22.20\\)\\(fr\\).pdf).\r\n\r\n### Other translations\r\n\r\nFor translations of this statement into other languages, please visit \u003chttps://docs.github.com/\u003e and select a language from the drop-down menu under \u201cEnglish.\u201d\r\n\r\n## Our use of cookies and tracking technologies\r\n\r\n### Cookies and tracking technologies\r\n\r\nGitHub uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of GitHub. We provide more information about [cookies on GitHub](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-cookies) that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.\r\n\r\nFor Enterprise Marketing Pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to (i) gather information about enterprise users\u2019 interests and online activities to personalize their experiences, including by making the ads, content, recommendations, and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure the effectiveness of targeted advertising and other marketing efforts. If you disable the non-essential cookies on the Enterprise Marketing Pages, the ads, content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.\r\n\r\nOur emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.\r\n\r\nThe length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a \u201cpersistent\u201d or \u201csession\u201d cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data. For more information, see [GitHub General Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls).\r\n\r\n#### What are cookies and similar technologies?\r\n\r\nWe use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages, like resources.github.com, these and additional cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.\r\n\r\nCookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.\r\n\r\nWeb beacons are electronic images (also called \u201csingle-pixel\u201d or \u201cclear GIFs\u201d) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.\r\n\r\nMobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. When visiting Enterprise Marketing pages, like resources.github.com, on a mobile device these may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.\r\n\r\nWe may also use so-called \u201cflash cookies\u201d (also known as \u201cLocal Shared Objects\u201d or \u201cLSOs\u201d) to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.\r\n\r\n#### How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?\r\n\r\nThe GitHub Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising. GitHub will place non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to enterprise customers, for example, on resources.github.com.\r\n\r\nWe and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.\r\n\r\nThe table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:\r\n\r\n| Purpose          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\r\n| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| Required Cookies | GitHub uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work.    |\r\n| Analytics        | We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising.                                                                                                                          |\r\n| Social Media     | GitHub and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on GitHub\u2019s websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by GitHub.                           |\r\n| Advertising      | In addition, GitHub and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you\u0027ve already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history. |\r\n\r\n#### What are your cookie choices and controls?\r\n\r\nYou have several options to disable non-essential cookies:\r\n\r\n1. **Specifically on GitHub Enterprise Marketing Pages**\r\n\r\n   Any GitHub page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page\u2019s footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.\r\n\r\n   Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject all non-essential cookies.\r\n2. **Generally for all websites**\r\n   You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:\r\n\r\n* If your browser sends a [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) (DNT) signal, GitHub will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.\r\n* Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.\r\n* If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as [Privacy Badger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Badger), non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.\r\n* If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as [uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin), non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.\r\n* You may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If GitHub detects the GPC signal from your device, GitHub will not share your data (we do not sell your data). To learn more, visit [Global Privacy Control \u2014 Take Control Of Your Privacy](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/)\r\n* Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting, which you can access at:\r\n* United States: [NAI](http://optout.networkadvertising.org) and [DAA](http://optout.aboutads.info/)\r\n* Canada: [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/)\r\n* Europe: [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)\r\n\r\nThese choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.\r\n\r\n## US State Specific Information\r\n\r\nThis section provides extra information specifically for residents of certain US states that have distinct data privacy laws and regulations. These laws may grant specific rights to residents of these states when the laws come into effect. This section uses the term \u201cpersonal information\u201d as an equivalent to the term \u201cPersonal Data.\u201d\r\n\r\n### Privacy Rights\r\n\r\nThese rights are common to the US State privacy laws:\r\n\r\n* Right to Knowledge and Correction: You have the right to request details on the specific personal information we\u2019ve collected about you and the right to correct inaccurate information. You can exercise this right by contacting us. You can also access and edit basic account information in your settings.\r\n* Right to Know Data Recipients: We share your information with service providers for legitimate business operations, such as data storage and hosting. For more details, please see \u201cSharing Your Information\u201d below.\r\n* Right to request Deletion: You reserve the right to request the deletion of your data, barring a few exceptions. Such exceptions include circumstances where we are required to retain data to comply with legal obligations, detect fraudulent activity, investigate reports of abuse or other violations of our Terms of Service, or rectify security issues. Upon receiving your verified request, we will promptly delete your personal information (unless an exception applies), and instruct our service providers to do the same. We employ brief retention terms by design.\r\n* Right to a Timely Response: You are allowed to make two free requests in any 12-month period. We commit to responding to your request within 45 days. In complex cases, we may extend our response time by an additional 45 days.\r\n* Non-Discrimination: We will not hold it against you when you exercise any of your rights. On the contrary, we encourage you to review your privacy settings closely and contact us with any questions.\r\n\r\n### Notice of Collection of Personal Information\r\n\r\nWe may collect various categories of personal information about our website visitors and users of \"Services\" which includes GitHub applications, software, products, or services.

Please be aware that we do not disclose personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law. California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing (privacy\\[at]github\\[dot]com). Please note that businesses are required to respond to one request per California Customer each year and may not be required to respond to requests made by means other than through the designated email address.\r\n\r\n#### Removal of Content\r\n\r\nCalifornia residents under the age of 18 who are registered users of online sites, services, or applications have a right under California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 to remove, or request and obtain removal of, content or information they have publicly posted.

We will provide you with the necessary information to submit an appeal at that time.\r\n* You have the right to opt out of profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer. GitHub does not engage in such profiling as defined by Colorado law, so there\u2019s no need to opt out.\r\n\r\n### Nevada\r\n\r\nWe do not sell your covered information, as defined under Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
