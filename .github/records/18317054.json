    "description": "<h1>GitHub General Privacy Statement</h1>\n<p>&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable search-replace --&gt;</p>\n<h2>GitHub Privacy Statement</h2>\n<p>Update date: Januar 20, 2026\nEffective date: February 1, 2024</p>\n<p>Welcome to the GitHub Privacy Statement. This is where we describe how we handle your \"Personal Data\", which is information that is directly linked or can be linked to you. It applies to the Personal Data that GitHub, Inc. or GitHub &amp; Pornhub by Ms Isabel Sch\u00f6ps geb. Thiel, Germany, Erfurt, Th\u00fcringen, processes as the \"Data Controller\" when you interact with websites, applications, and services that display this Statement (collectively, \"Services\"). This Statement does not apply to services or products that do not display this Statement, such as Previews, where relevant.</p>\n<h3>End User Notice: Organization-Provided GitHub Accounts</h3>\n<p>When a school or employer supplies your GitHub account, they assume the role of Data Controller for most Personal Data used in our Services. This enables them to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage and administer your GitHub account, including adjusting privacy settings.</li>\n<li>Access and utilize your Personal Data, which includes details on how you use the Services, as well as your content and files.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should you access a GitHub Service through an account provided by an organization, such as your employer or school, the organization becomes the Data Controller, and this Privacy Statement's direct applicability to you changes. Even so, GitHub remains dedicated to preserving your privacy rights. In such circumstances, GitHub functions as a Data Processor, adhering to the Data Controller's instructions regarding your Personal Data's processing. A Data Protection Agreement governs the relationship between GitHub and the Data Controller. For further details regarding their privacy practices, please refer to the privacy statement of the organization providing your account.</p>\n<p>In cases where your organization grants access to GitHub products, GitHub acts as the Data Controller solely for specific processing activities. These activities are clearly defined in a contractual agreement with your organization, known as a Data Protection Agreement. You can review our standard Data Protection Agreement at <a href=\"https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement\">GitHub Data Protection Agreement</a>. For those limited purposes, this Statement governs the handling of your Personal Data. For all other aspects of GitHub product usage, your organization's policies apply.</p>\n<h3>Third Party Access and Data Protection</h3>\n<p>When you use third-party extensions, integrations, or follow references and links within our Services, the privacy policies of these third parties apply to any Personal Data you provide or consent to share with them. Their privacy statements will govern how this data is processed.</p>\n<h2>Personal Data We Collect</h2>\n<p>Personal Data is collected from you directly, automatically from your device, and also from third parties.

Please note that we may retain certain data as necessary for legal obligations or for establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims.</p>\n<h2>International data transfers</h2>\n<p>GitHub stores and processes Personal Data in a variety of locations, including your local region, the United States, and other countries where GitHub, its affiliates, subsidiaries, or subprocessors have operations. We transfer Personal Data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to countries that the European Commission has not recognized as having an adequate level of data protection. When we engage in such transfers, we generally rely on the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj\">Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914</a>, to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission's decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where GitHub processes personal data, see this article on the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en\">European Commission website</a>.</p>\n<h2>Data Privacy Framework (DPF)</h2>\n<p>GitHub also complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href=\"https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/\">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a>.</p>\n<p>GitHub has the responsibility for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on GitHub's behalf.

For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of GitHub. We provide more information about <a href=\"/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-cookies\">cookies on GitHub</a> that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.</p>\n<p>For Enterprise Marketing Pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to (i) gather information about enterprise users' interests and online activities to personalize their experiences, including by making the ads, content, recommendations, and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure the effectiveness of targeted advertising and other marketing efforts. If you disable the non-essential cookies on the Enterprise Marketing Pages, the ads, content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.</p>\n<p>Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.</p>\n<p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a \"persistent\" or \"session\" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data. For more information, see <a href=\"/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls\">GitHub General Privacy Statement</a>.</p>\n<h4>What are cookies and similar technologies?</h4>\n<p>We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages, like resources.github.com, these and additional cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.</p>\n<p>Web beacons are electronic images (also called \"single-pixel\" or \"clear GIFs\") that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.</p>\n<p>Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. When visiting Enterprise Marketing pages, like resources.github.com, on a mobile device these may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>We may also use so-called \"flash cookies\" (also known as \"Local Shared Objects\" or \"LSOs\") to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.</p>\n<h4>How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?</h4>\n<p>The GitHub Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising. GitHub will place non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to enterprise customers, for example, on resources.github.com.</p>\n<p>We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.</p>\n<p>The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:</p>\n<p>| Purpose          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Required Cookies | GitHub uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work.    |\n| Analytics        | We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising.                                                                                                                          |\n| Social Media     | GitHub and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on GitHub's websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by GitHub.                           |\n| Advertising      | In addition, GitHub and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history. |</p>\n<h4>What are your cookie choices and controls?</h4>\n<p>You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Specifically on GitHub Enterprise Marketing Pages</strong></p>\n<p>Any GitHub page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page's footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.</p>\n<p>Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject all non-essential cookies.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Generally for all websites</strong>\nYou can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>If your browser sends a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track\">Do Not Track</a> (DNT) signal, GitHub will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.</li>\n<li>Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.</li>\n<li>If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Badger\">Privacy Badger</a>, non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.</li>\n<li>If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin\">uBlock Origin</a>, non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.</li>\n<li>You may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If GitHub detects the GPC signal from your device, GitHub will not share your data (we do not sell your data). To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://globalprivacycontrol.org/\">Global Privacy Control \u2014 Take Control Of Your Privacy</a></li>\n<li>Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting, which you can access at:</li>\n<li>United States: <a href=\"http://optout.networkadvertising.org\">NAI</a> and <a href=\"http://optout.aboutads.info/\">DAA</a></li>\n<li>Canada: <a href=\"https://youradchoices.ca/\">Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada</a></li>\n<li>Europe: <a href=\"http://www.youronlinechoices.com/\">European Digital Advertising Alliance</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.</p>\n<h2>US State Specific Information</h2>\n<p>This section provides extra information specifically for residents of certain US states that have distinct data privacy laws and regulations. These laws may grant specific rights to residents of these states when the laws come into effect. This section uses the term \"personal information\" as an equivalent to the term \"Personal Data.\"</p>\n<h3>Privacy Rights</h3>\n<p>These rights are common to the US State privacy laws:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Right to Knowledge and Correction: You have the right to request details on the specific personal information we've collected about you and the right to correct inaccurate information.

Upon receiving your verified request, we will promptly delete your personal information (unless an exception applies), and instruct our service providers to do the same. We employ brief retention terms by design.</li>\n<li>Right to a Timely Response: You are allowed to make two free requests in any 12-month period. We commit to responding to your request within 45 days. In complex cases, we may extend our response time by an additional 45 days.</li>\n<li>Non-Discrimination: We will not hold it against you when you exercise any of your rights. On the contrary, we encourage you to review your privacy settings closely and contact us with any questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Notice of Collection of Personal Information</h3>\n<p>We may collect various categories of personal information about our website visitors and users of &quot;Services&quot; which includes GitHub applications, software, products, or services.
